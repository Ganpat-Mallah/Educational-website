        <h3>Covered Topics:</h3>
        <button class="accordion-btn">Introduction to Bootstrap</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that helps you design responsive websites quickly. The grid system is one of the key features that allows for creating flexible layouts. Bootstrap also comes with pre-designed UI components like buttons, modals, and navigation bars that can be easily customized.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Working with APIs</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, allow your website to communicate with external data sources. By working with APIs, you can integrate features like weather data, social media feeds, and financial information. You will use JavaScript to send requests to these APIs and then process the responses, typically in JSON format.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Deploying Your Website</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Deploying a website involves making it accessible on the internet. You need to choose a hosting provider, set up your domain, and upload your files. Common hosting platforms include GitHub Pages, Netlify, and AWS. Deployment can also include setting up continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to automatically update the website as you make changes.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Add more topics below -->
        <button class="accordion-btn">Responsive Design with Media Queries</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Media queries allow you to change the style of your website depending on the screen size. This is the foundation of responsive web design. For example, you can change the layout of the page on mobile devices to a single column instead of multiple columns. By using media queries, you ensure that your website looks great on all screen sizes, from smartphones to large desktop monitors.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">CSS Flexbox</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Flexbox is a layout model that allows you to create complex layouts with simple CSS properties. Flexbox helps you control the alignment, direction, and size of elements within a container. It’s perfect for building responsive layouts because it can adjust the positions of elements depending on the screen size or available space.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">CSS Grid Layout</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>CSS Grid Layout is a powerful layout system that allows you to create two-dimensional grids for your web pages. With CSS Grid, you can control both the rows and columns of your layout, giving you full control over the placement of elements. It is a great alternative to Flexbox for complex layouts, especially when you need precise control over both vertical and horizontal spacing.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Web Security Basics</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Web security is essential to protect your website and users from attacks such as hacking, data breaches, and malicious scripts. You need to follow best practices such as using HTTPS, sanitizing user inputs, and regularly updating your dependencies. Implementing secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) also helps protect sensitive data.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Authentication with OAuth</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>OAuth is a popular authentication method that allows users to log into your website using third-party accounts such as Google or Facebook. This eliminates the need for users to remember another password and also provides better security. OAuth works by allowing users to authorize your website to access their data from a third-party service.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Version Control with Git</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code over time. With Git, you can collaborate with other developers by managing different versions of your code. GitHub is a popular platform for hosting your Git repositories and sharing your code with others. It allows you to commit, branch, and merge code with ease.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">CSS Animations</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>CSS animations allow you to create dynamic visual effects on your website. With keyframes and animation properties, you can create smooth transitions, fades, and movements. CSS animations can be used to enhance user experience by adding interactive effects, such as buttons that change color or hover effects that make the site feel more interactive.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">JavaScript Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular help you build complex web applications more easily. React allows you to build components and manage the state of your app. Vue is a progressive framework that focuses on simplicity and performance. Angular is a comprehensive framework that helps you build scalable, enterprise-level applications with a full set of features out-of-the-box.</p>
